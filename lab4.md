**Step 2: Git Clone into ieng6.**

In this step, I used the command `git clone` then used `<cmd C>` and `<cmd V>` to copy the SSH URL from my lab7 fork to the command line. Then 
I pressed `<enter>` to run the command, which successfully cloned the repository to ieng6.

**Step 3: Running the test, demonstrating failure.**

My first step was to use `ls` to see the contents of ieng6. Then I navigated to lab7 using `cd l` then `<tab>` to fill in the rest, and pressed `<enter>` to execute. 
Then I used `ls` again and `bash t` + `<tab>` to fill in the rest and pressed `<enter>` to run the tests.
